# NSS-Code-Challenge: Palindromes



#### This is a code challenge that determines whether or not a given word or words in a list are a palindrome (_a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward_)  or not

## To Run The Code
#### This project uses a Makefile to execute the code. Once the project is cloned, you can simply run `make run_tests` and it will execute the code in the `challenge.py`  file
